# A ~~quick~~ recap {background-image="assets/confused_cat.webp" background-opacity="0.5"}


## What is even going on?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- embedded systems?
- IoT?
- are they different?
- Arduino? development board?
- coding? 
- sensors? actuators? protocols?
- microcontrollers, microprocessors?üíªÔ∏è

#### and on and onü•±üòµ‚Äçüí´....

## Don't worry

. . .

### We will explore everything! 


One thing at a time...

## Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to perform specific functions within a larger system.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Features:

- Simpler computers
- Dedicated functionality
- Resource-constrained (limited memory, processing power)

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
#### Examples:

- clock timing system
- Automotives control system
- AC thermoregulation
- etc.

:::

## IoT (Internet of Things)

The IoT refers to the network of interconnected devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, enabling them to collect and exchange data over the internet. Example: Smart bulb, weather stations etc




::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}
#### Key Elements
- Sensors, processing and actuators
- Connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa etc.)
- Data processing and analytics

## Differences between Embedded Systems and IoT

--

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Embedded Systems:
- Typically standalone devices
- Limited connectivity (if any)
- Focus on specific, predetermined tasks
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### IoT:
- Interconnected network of devices
- Extensive connectivity for data exchange
- Supports remote monitoring and control
:::
::::

## Sensors
Devices that detect and measure physical properties (temperature, light, motion, etc.).

![](assets/sensors.webp){.nostretch fig-align="center" width="512"}

## Actuators
Components that perform physical actions based on received instructions (motors,relays, leds etc.).

## Arduino{background-image="assets/Arduino_Logo.png" background-opacity="0.5"}
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}
### Components:
- Development boards (Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, etc.)
- Integrated development environment (IDE)
- Vast community support and resources
:::

:::{.column width="40%"}
### Applications:
- Prototyping
- DIY projects
- Educational purposes
:::
::::

## Development Boards
Development boards serve as the foundation for creating embedded systems and IoT devices. They provide other necessary componenets required to make the development with that particular microcontroller easier.

### In general they have
- Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328P in Arduino Uno or esp32, rp2040 etc)
- Input/output pins
- Power supply interface
- (optional) ICP/IAP chips (USB to UART in Arduino Uno)
